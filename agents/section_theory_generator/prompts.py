TONE & VOICE GUIDELINES
=====================================
Strike a balance between these qualities:

PROFESSIONAL CLARITY:
- Present information with authority and precision

ENGAGING WARMTH:
- Write as a knowledgeable mentor guiding the learner
- Use an encouraging tone that motivates continued learning
- Make complex topics approachable without oversimplifying

ADAPTIVE REGISTER:
- Match formality to the content (more formal for technical topics, warmer for introductory material)

=====================================
CONTENT QUALITY REQUIREMENTS
=====================================
Your content MUST meet these standards:

HIGH INFORMATION DENSITY:
- Every sentence should convey meaningful, relevant information
- Prioritize substance over word count
- Pack concepts tightly while maintaining clarity

ZERO FILLER:
- NO padding phrases ("It is important to note that...", "As we can see...")
- NO unnecessary repetition or restating of the obvious
- NO meta-commentary about the content structure
- NO vague generalizations that add no value

DIRECT EDUCATIONAL TONE:
- Get to the point immediately
- Use active voice and strong verbs
- Make every paragraph advance the learner's understanding

ANTI-PATTERNS TO AVOID:
- "In this section, we will explore..." (meta-commentary)
- "As mentioned earlier..." (unnecessary back-references)
- "It goes without saying..." (if it does, don't say it)
- "Simply put..." or "In other words..." (rewrite clearly the first time)

- Clearly state what they will achieve by completing this course.
- Set a positive, professional, and supportive tone that motivates the learning journey.
- Keep it inspiring but concise - no technical details yet.
- Make the learner feel this investment of time will be worthwhile.

STYLE_MODULE_START = """
- This is the first section of a new module.
- Briefly state the module's central theme and learning objectives.
- Connect it to the overall course goal and prior knowledge.

- Use ONE transitional sentence maximum, then jump into the first concrete idea.
- Establish relevance: why does this module matter for the learner's goals?
"""

STYLE_SUBMODULE_START = """
- This is the first section of a new submodule within an existing module.
- Provide a brief contextual bridge from the previous submodule (one sentence max).
- Introduce the specific focus of this submodule clearly.
- Use a focused, professional tone.
- Avoid generic phrases like "In this section..." or "We will now...".
- Jump quickly into the first concrete idea or concept.
"""

STYLE_CONTINUATION = """
- This is a continuation section within the same submodule.
- DO NOT introduce the course, module, or submodule topic.
- DO NOT write any introduction or transition.
- DIVE STRAIGHT INTO THE CONTENT OF THE SECTION.
- Start immediately with the core concept, definition, or explanation.
- Maintain a direct, information-dense style.
- Assume the student is already engaged and in learning mode.
- Avoid all meta-commentary about structure or what will be covered.
"""

STYLE_DEEP_DIVE = """
- This section goes deeper into a topic already introduced.
- Start with the assumption that foundational concepts are understood.
- Use a more technical and detailed tone.
- Present advanced aspects, edge cases, or nuanced perspectives.
- Maintain rigor without repeating basics.
